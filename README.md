# Ship 6502 (working title)

## The pitch

It is the year 6502, and you are the software guy aboard a spaceship running on tech from the 1980s.

At least, that's the plan.

Welcome! You've stumbled across the repository for a barely-started game I'm making. There's not much here, and most of the stuff that _is_ here probably won't stay for very long.

I'm a huge fan of games that basically involve doing software dev, which is also my actual day job. (Do what you love...)

I also recently got given an old [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET), which rekindled my love for, and fascination with, old tech.

_Also_ also, I love games where you control something complicated like a spaceship, but each of the individual components of that ship is simulated in detail, so you feel like a person piloting a ship, instead of the ghame abstracting that detail away so you're just moving a ship around with the arrow keys.

So, I've decided I'd like to try to make a game that scratches all of those itches for me.

## The premise

Imagine a spaceship that runs on old-style tech from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. It's not so far-fetched: we made it to the moon in 1969, so we _literally have_ built spaceships that run on even more basic computer technology than that.

This is sort of related to the "cassettepunk" aesthetic – imagine the movie _Alien_, where they're on a ship full of cathode-ray displays and clunky plastic buttons.

There's an argument to be made (and I intend on writing a blog post about this) that this era of technology is actually _better_ for spaceships and other machines: old technology tends to be simpler, easier to reason about, _more reliable_ and _easier to fix_ than the advanced electronics in modern cars – capable of some really clever calculations, yes, but difficult to fix and sometimes less safe than more basic alternatives.

So that's the premise – a spaceship that runs on old-style computers. I imagine the core gameplay loop, then, being a Zachtronics-style series of puzzles where you must use assembly-like programming to fix various things aboard the ship.

I'm also intrigued by the idea of the ship being totally freeform, sandbox-style, with you free to interact with its entire computer system at will, and challenge yourself to, for example, write a whole guidance system from scratch or something like that.

## The outro

That's the idea. I've only just started, so we'll see how far I get!
